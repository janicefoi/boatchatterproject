# Boat Chatter Project

The **Boat Chatter Project** is a web application built using the Django framework and PostgreSQL database. It facilitates the booking of boats for various purposes, providing users with a seamless experience from boat selection to payment confirmation.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register for an account and log in securely to access the booking features.
- **Boat Management**: Boats can be easily added and managed through the Django admin interface. Each boat can have a name, description, price, image, category, brand, availability status, accommodation capacity, and booking date.
- **Category-based Navigation**: Boats are divided into categories such as Fishing Boats, Sail Boats, and Yachts. Users can browse through these categories to find the boat that suits their needs.
- **Dashboard Representation**: The dashboard displays boats in an item card format, showcasing boat details, images, and a "Rent Per Day" button for easy access.
- **Booking Process**: When a user selects the "Rent Per Day" option, they are prompted to choose a booking date. The system checks the availability of the selected boat for the chosen date. If available, the user proceeds to the booking page.
- **Payment Integration**: Payment methods include Mpesa, with Daraja API integration for seamless transactions. Users input their Mpesa number and receive a prompt with the booking price. Upon successful payment confirmation, the booking status is updated to "confirmed."
- **Email Notifications**: Users receive booking confirmation emails, providing assurance and details about their confirmed bookings.
